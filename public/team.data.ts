I did my graduation in Information Technology from Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology, Delhi. I have decent understanding of full-stack development using MERN stack, Spring Boot framework, SQL, and programming languages like C++, python, JavaScript.
        On the personal front, I like to play cricket, table tennis, badminton, etc.  in my leisure time. I also enjoy binge-watching web series like GOT, Money Heist, TFM, etc. I like to learn about new technologies and enjoy programming and also follow technology blogs/video channels online.
        With a positive outlook, I am looking forward to be a part of the Cvent family.`,
